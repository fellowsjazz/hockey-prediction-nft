              Cup Pick is a unique NFT project because all elements of the collection are on-chain! But what does that mean??
              <br/><br/>
              Normally, NFTs are &#34;pointers&#34; to content, like images, videos, audio, and metadata (i.e. the data that tells NFT websites like opensea all kinds of info), that are stored in a different location, like a webserver, cloud database, or decentralized storage like IPFS!
              <br/><br/>
              Cup Pick is different, because it doesn't use ANY outside storage providers - everything is stored on the block chain!
              <br/><br/>
              That means that once a &#34;Cup Pick Prediction&#34; is minted, its attributes (like team selection, prediction date, and minter address) can never be changed!
              <br/><br/>
              This is perfect, because the whole point of Cup Pick is to have verifiable proof that you predicted (on a certain date) that your team would win the Stanley Cup!
